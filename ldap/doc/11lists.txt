When using the puppet Lists, a new property shoudl be added to your type, because the lists are deoending on that one :

newproperty(:memberschip)

the values that should be defined for this property are :

-inclusive -> the complete list, so if other elements are assigned, they will be removed, and only the values 
              provided by puppet wil be accepted

- minimum -> The values porovide by puppet are 'added' to the alredy excistinng values.

In our case, the membership will both be used for all lists, and set default to inclusive.

!!!! Orderedlist -> all values will keep the order in which they are given.  This is not a sorted list !!!

and the array of values  is translated to a comma separated string
