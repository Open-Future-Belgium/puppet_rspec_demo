* we need an algoritme to translate from an -or- ed value to labels
   and doing something with this modulus,

* internally the -or- ed value ??, and translating this to the label stuff ?
  (this makes comparing atuff much easier, since it is only one value, but is
   very hard to read)
* check for some special cases :
  - -1/any, 0 and 32768/all are  special cases.  If they are used, only one value is permitted
