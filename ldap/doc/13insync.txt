for those properties where the insync? method  is more than just string  compares, we
need to override the method wot a custom one.


We need to do this for the following parameters !!


TODO :  lookup how insync? can be te tested with rspec !!!

    def insync?( is )
      if ( is == :absent && ( @should == :absent || @should.empty? ) ) || ( ( is == :absent || is.empty? ) && @should == :absent )
        return true
      end

      if is.is_a? Array
        sortedis = is.sort
      else
        sortedis = [ is ]
      end

      sortedshould = @should.sort

      return sortedis == sortedshould
    end
